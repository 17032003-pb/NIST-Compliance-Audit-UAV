# 🛡️ NIST 800-53 Compliance Audit: UAV Ground Control System

### 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a **GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance)** audit for a commercial drone operator ("SkyLogistics"). The goal was to evaluate their **Ground Control Station (GCS)** against **NIST 800-53** standards to prepare for government contract approval.

### 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
* **Frameworks:** NIST SP 800-53, ISO 27001 concepts.
* **Risk Assessment:** Mapping technical vulnerabilities (e.g., weak encryption) to business risks (drone hijacking).
* **Aeronautical Context:** Securing telemetry (MavLink) and engineering workstations.

### 📂 Files Included
* `UAV_System_Audit_Checklist.xlsx`: Detailed control-by-control inspection.
* `Audit_Report_Summary.pdf`: Executive-level summary of risks and "No-Go" decision.
